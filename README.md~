# Minimal_IMAP_MCMC

9.8.19
Minimal IMAP MCMC is a rapid Bayesian approach to Causal Structure Learning.  It is in Python.
In collaboration with Tamara Broderick's lab and based on algorithm by Raj Agrawal.  The app code here
can be launched into an interactive tab by calling 'bokeh serve --show <folder name> from the folder 
containing the app folder.  This will launch a new tab which runs the program fully.

New updates to come!

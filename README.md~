# Minimal_IMAP_MCMC

9.8.19
Minimal IMAP MCMC is a rapid Bayesian approach to Causal Structure Learning.  It is written in Python. In addition to calling it from the command line users can also use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to call the program.
This work was done in collaboration with Tamara Broderick's group and it is based on algorithm developed by Raj Agrawal.  The app code here
can be launched into an interactive tab by calling 'bokeh serve --show <folder name>' from the folder 
containing the app folder.  This will launch a new tab which runs the program fully.

New updates to come!

# Minimal_IMAP_MCMC

9.8.19
Minimal IMAP MCMC is a rapid Bayesian approach to Causal Structure Learning.  It is written in Python. In addition to calling it from the command line users can also use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to call the program.
This work was done in collaboration with Tamara Broderick's group and it is based on algorithm developed by Raj Agrawal.


To launch the GUI call 'bokeh serve --show minIMAPapp' from the folder containing the application folder.  This will launch the app into a new tab in your browser.

New updates to come!
